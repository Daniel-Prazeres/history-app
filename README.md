## Programming

In general my programming followed the theme of minimalism as simplicity, in order to ensure code readability. To do this I had to use funtions of Kotlin we havent let learned such as loop logic. While a little advanced the advantages of using loops within the context of this app made scanning through arrays a matter of at most 4 lines of code using a loop rather than a massive nested if statement or switch. In fact I used a loop for this exact purpose, using one to scann through an array of ages and checking if any matched with the age the user had specified.

## User Interface

The user interface was also designed to be minimalistic purely for ease of use. The simple design lended itself to being read by users easily which was considerably important as the target audience of this app was kids, who often struggle navigating complex app and websites. Furthermore I chose a purple color scheme to compliment the light purple buttons that were on the screen. I used a simple purple gradient going from dark to light down the screen which guides the users eyes down the screen towards the age input and the small exert on the person the age matched with.

## Bugs

I came across a plethora of bugs while programing this app, of which I had fixed all but one which was a nullpointexception that occured when the user inputted nothing as an age. However I fixed a bug pertaining to entering numbers that were larger or smaller than the sample size of data within the app. Secondly I completely prevented issues pertaing to the user inputing words as their age by using a number widget which only allows the user to type in whole numbers and nothing more.
